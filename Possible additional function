## If the importing images doesn't work then we can maybe do something like this.
### Below code is only to be used if images cannot be imported into precious function

questions_dict = {'What is O2?':'Oxygen', 'What is H2O?':'Water'}

def final_task(): 
    final_question = random.choice(list(questions_dict.keys()))
    answer = input(final_question).upper()
    
    if answer == questions_dict[final_question]:
        print('You escaped! Good job!')
    elif not answer.isalpha():
        print('Guess must be in the form of a word!')
    else:
        print('RIP the homie...')
