# Oh no!

You are a cat and you've found yourself in a sticky predicament! 

You're trapped in a PI's laboratory and you need to guess his password to leave the room.

The problem: If you guess the password incorrectly, a cloud of poisonous gas will fill release and fill the room!

Guess the passcode one letter at a time and escape!

## Rules and Hints:

- The PI is a huge biology nerd and his passcode reflects it.

- Once you guess a letter correctly, the letter and it's proper position will show in the Passcode region.

- You can guess one letter at a time... but every wrong letter loses you one of your 9 lives! 

- After 9 incorrect guesses, you lose!



##### Can you escape?  (ꏿ ᆺ ꏿ)

# Reflection


### Jillian Menez: 
- I enjoyed this project and I had fun with creating a silly narrative along with it. I entered this class without any prior coding experience and I did not believe that I would be able to carry out such a task by the end of the quarter. The code behind our little game is very simple, but I am really proud of how we were able to work it out and build our own game. I am more confident in my abilty to troubleshoot after this assignment as I could not just turn to google to answer my questions, I had to actively search through python-specific forums and look through others' code and resources in order to piece together the answers I needed. Our project felt so difficult when we were working through it, but the end product is so simple. It really gives me perspective to just how much more there is to learn, I haven't even scratched the surface. I enjoyed my dive into coding and I intend to continue learning python and explore other coding languages as well.
