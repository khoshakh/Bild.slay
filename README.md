# Unnamed Hangman Game

## Project Description
We have created a simple based on the concept of hangman, only with a small twist! The idea is that the player is a cat with nine lives, trapped in a scientist's laboratory and you must escape. The passcode is one word taken from a biology-oriented wordlist. 

For this project, we wanted to incorporate some of our favorite things: biology, word games, and cats! 

We achieved our goal by creating three different functions. The first function is a simple one in which we coded to allow us to choose a random word from a list of biology-related words we created. 

The second function was 

And the final function was the "hangman"-style game itself. This is a particularly large function in which we embedded little emoticon cats that show distress if you get a guess wrong, and relief if you choose correctly.
