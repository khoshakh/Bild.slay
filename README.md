# Unnamed Hangman Game

## Project Description
We have created a simple based on the concept of hangman, only with a small twist! The idea is that the player is a cat with nine lives, trapped in a scientist's laboratory and you must escape. The passcode is one word taken from a biology-oriented wordlist. 

For this project, we wanted to incorporate some of our favorite things: biology, word games, and cats! 

We achieved our goal by creating three different functions. The first function is a simple one in which we coded to allow us to choose a random word from a list of biology-related words we created. 

The second function was 

And the final function was the "hangman"-style game itself. This is a particularly large function in which we embedded little emoticon cats that show distress if you get a guess wrong, and relief if you choose correctly.

# Reflection


### Jillian Menez: 
- I enjoyed this project and I had fun with creating a silly narrative along with it. I entered this class without any prior coding experience and I did not believe that I would be able to carry out such a task by the end of the quarter. The code behind our little game is very simple, but I am really proud of how we were able to work it out and build our own game. I am more confident in my abilty to troubleshoot after this assignment as I could not just turn to google to answer my questions, I had to actively search through python-specific forums and look through others' code and resources in order to piece together the answers I needed. Our project felt so difficult when we were working through it, but the end product is so simple. It really gives me perspective to just how much more there is to learn, I haven't even scratched the surface. I enjoyed my dive into coding and I intend to continue learning python and explore other coding languages as well.
